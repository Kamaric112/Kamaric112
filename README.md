### Hi there 👋

There is the land where I share my projects and take a break.

- 💞️ I am a frontend developer, also a problem solver. I am motivated to build simple and elegant websites that are visually pleasing and user-friendly
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS and NextJS recently.
- 😀 I like to code, read and watch Better Call Saul (insert theme song)
- 📫 How to reach me: Email: qu.truong99@gmail.com
